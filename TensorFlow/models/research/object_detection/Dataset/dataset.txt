In this video, I will create a dataset of 5 vegetables(Onion, Potato, Garlic, Capsicum, and Tomato).

It can be done in two ways:
1. Take lots of photos of objects. It will take lot of time to do that.

2.
- Take 5-7 videos of object in different backgrounds, lighting, distance, etc.
- The video length should be around 2-3 minutes.
- Then we will convert videos into images.
- When the number of classes increases you need more images to increase accuracy 
- Using this method you just have to take a video of objects for 2-3 mintus.

Now we will install labelImg:
pip install labelImg

Open labelImg
1. Open Dir: Select image folder path
2. Format: Select PascalVOC for Tensorflow 2 Object detection API.
3. Create RectBox: Use to create box of different class
   Do this process for all object in image

4. Save: It will create a xml file for every image.

Do this process for all images.
I am done with all images.
Now I have to split these images into two:
1. Train: 90% of the images.
2. Test: 10% of the images.

Create two folder in images
I have 263 images in this folder 
Select 26 images along with there xml file and cut-paste it into test folder.

Make sure to check on xml files

Now remaining images and there xml files goes to train foler.

Now we have successfully create our dataset.

Now inside TensorFlow folder we will create some folder
Now copy-paste images folder here.

Now create another folder for labelmap
Now create a empty labelmap in pbtxt format
Or you can copy and paste it from :
TensorFlow\models\research\object_detection\data
We will copy this one
we have only 5 classes

Now give an id to every class
Make sure the name you have written here should be same as in xml files.


Now we will generate tfrecord for train and test images.
Basically a single file contain all images and there label in it.

This python file will convert images and xml file into tfrecord.

Link of this python file will be in the description.

Train:

python generate_tfrecord.py -x D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/images/train -l D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/annotations/labelmap.pbtxt -o D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/annotations/train.record 



path_of_train_folder:
D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/images/train

path_of_labelmap: 
D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/annotations/labelmap.pbtxt

path_of_output_tfrecord:
D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/annotations/train.record 

Now replace each path 
We have successfully created train.record
Do this for test


Test:

Replace test folder and tfrecord name
python generate_tfrecord.py -x D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/images/test -l D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/annotations/labelmap.pbtxt -o D:/object_detetion/TensorFlow/workspace/training/annotations/test.record 

We have successfully create tfrecord for test and train

Next video we will train model using these three files
